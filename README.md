  ## Description

  What is this app and what does it do:

  This app is designed for a user who wants to add info into a note taking system. Using mainly Express, the note taker adds a note, saves the entered text, and appends this as a new note. Additionally, the user can delete any note they'd like to once the user no longer deems it necessary.

  Technologies used: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node, Express, fs, path, markdown, Git, and Heroku. Please render on Chrome for best results.
